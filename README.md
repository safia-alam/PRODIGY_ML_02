# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
### 🔧 Prodigy InfoTech Internship | Task 2 by Safia Alam H B

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies the K-Means Clustering algorithm to segment customers of a retail store based on their age, annual income, and spending score. The aim is to help the business identify customer groups for targeted marketing strategies.

## 🧾 Dataset Details
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Mall Customers Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)
- **Features**: 
  - `CustomerID`
  - `Gender`
  - `Age`
  - `Annual Income (k$)`
  - `Spending Score (1-100)`

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **5 clusters** were identified using the Elbow Method.
- **Cluster 1**: Young, high-income, and high spenders — ideal premium customers.
- **Cluster 2**: High-income but low spenders — need engagement strategy.
- **Cluster 3**: Low-income, moderate spenders — value-seekers.
- **Cluster 4**: Average earners with moderate spend — stable customers.
- **Cluster 5**: Low-income, high spenders — potentially impulsive buyers.

## ✅ Conclusion
K-Means clustering helped uncover customer segments based on spending behavior. These insights can improve targeting, drive personalized promotions, and optimize product offerings.
